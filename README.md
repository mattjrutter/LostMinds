# LostMinds

This project was for a Video Game Design class using C++ and the SDL.

Most of the code was adapted from Let's Make Games "BirchEngine," however, the game's audio system was coded from scratch using the BirchEngine's technique.
The game showcases examples of displaying a grid map, using a camera, sprite animations, projectiles, and sound that changes in accordance with the player's position.
